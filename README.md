An interactive computer-vision application that enables users to draw on the screen using real-time hand gestures. The system activates the device camera and leverages MediaPipe JS for accurate hand-tracking and landmark detection. By interpreting finger movements and gestures, the application allows users to draw, write, or interact with a virtual canvas without any physical input devices. It supports smooth, low-latency tracking, intuitive gesture controls (such as draw, pause, or clear), and real-time visual feedback. This project demonstrates practical applications of web-based computer vision, gesture recognition, and human–computer interaction, highlighting how camera input and AI-driven hand tracking can create touch-free, immersive user experiences directly in the browser.
